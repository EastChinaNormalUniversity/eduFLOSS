eduFLOSS means free/libre opensource software which can be used in education. 

As we all know tool is of great value for both teachers and students, but many teachers donnot know in what situation and what tools are available for them to use for a more efficient teaching or learning experience. What we want to do is just collecting those tools, especially those free/libre opensource software. It is not that easy job. What challenge us here includes:

1.what information about those software should be get, or say, what are important for us;
I have done a part of this job. You can get that from this site:http://www.xmind.net/m/CpaQ/ 
I think we should make a more detail one which includes features of mobile app and web app, and something else.
2.To get those features we gethered be used we should consider the teacher and students. Thus, database schema should be designed for the following work.
3.To design the web site front end. We would use the tool axure to make a rapid prototype for our future website.
4.To develop the web site. Python is the only langurage according to my imagine.
  
The next nearest step is to make crawler to gether software info. 
The file cssselector.py is a crawler made by myself. Its function is limited which would only analysis only one website. I think we should have more wide scope of finding wares such as in github or the more better site as sourceforge I thought. If we can use the github API or sourceforge API to get the statistic data, it is the best.
